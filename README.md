# Todo list App

A very simple beginner app that I made to get more familiar with reactjs library and localstorage API.  

## Technologies used
- HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript (ES6)
- reactjs & react-dom
- Local Storage API

## Features
- Users can add tasks to the todo list and remove tasks from todo list.
- A very simple quotes app is right beside the todolist that randomly shows an inspirational quote.
